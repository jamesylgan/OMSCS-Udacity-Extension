# OMSCS-Udacity-Extension
An open source extension to make it easier to find the Udacity login link

Please submit PRs for any improvements with a short explanation of what the PR does.

# TODO:
1. Larger text size for link
2. Better formatting for link - no longer just replacing the page title
3. More elegant element selection - select the footer and then select the last element, to account for any potential changes in ID numbering


# INSTALLATION:
Visit chrome://extensions in your browser and ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

Click Load unpacked extension and select the directory in which your extension files live.
